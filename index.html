        <h1>Kenyan Coffee</h1>
        <p>Despite Kenya's neighbor Ethiopia producing coffee for hundreds of years, Kenya didn't enter the coffee game until the 1890's. In their short time however, they have made quite the name for themselves in the coffee world. The volcanic soil of Mt. Kenya and the weather conditions make Kenya quite suitable for our favorite drink.</p>
        <p>Kenyan coffees are best known for their crisp acidity, intricate spice notes, and fruit forward nature. This comes down to a combination of the terroir, the SL28 and SL34 varietals, and focus on quality. Kenyan coffee is graded on a size scale (largest bean to smallest bean): E, PB, AA, AB, C, TT, T, MH/ML. Through vigorous screening during processing, the beans are sorted into their corresponding grades to be sold as a lot. This ensures some consistency in quality and flavor</p>
        <p>Another attribute that contributes to the unique flavor of Kenyan coffees is the processing method. Coffee is the seed of a coffee cherry, so in order to get just the seed as the final product, something has to be done to remove the fruit flesh from the seed. In Kenya they use the Washed Method, which is the use of water to "wash" the pulp away. This yields a clean, complex, and consistent flavor profile.</p>
        <p>Consistency is highly valuable as the economic landscape of coffee farming is mostly being part of a local farmer cooperative. Farmers grow and harvest their coffee cherries, and make a cut based on the weight they sell. The cooperative in turn will provide farmers with training programs to help ensure the highest quality and consistency.</p>

        <h1>The Farm</h1>
        <p>This coffee comes from the Mutheka Farmer's Cooperative. They were founded in 2004 after the local farmer cooperative split up. They are comprised of over 6,000 local coffee growers who bring their coffee cherries to one of Mutheka's 7 processing mills to be processed.
        </p>
        <p>The Kiandu Factory is the largest washing station run by the Mutheka Group. Kiandu consists of 1900 members, who painstakingly process roughly 2500 metric tons of coffee cherries annually. In recent years, Kiandu has been at odds with Mutheka making acquisition of this coffee difficult.
