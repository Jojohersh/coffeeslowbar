        <h1>Coffee</h1>
        <p>Guatemala has been producing coffee since the mid 1700s, but only as a main crop since the late 1800s, making up 90% of Guatemala's economy by 1880. Through reforms, the production of coffee was pushed to be a major crop. This push however simultaneously strengthened the economy and took a large amount of land from the indigenous people.</p>
        <p>Politics and agriculture have long intertwined with each other throughout Guatemala's coffee history. Arguments over land reforms and government intervention were some of the main kindling for Guatemala's civil war. Since the end of the civil war, Guatemala's coffee industry has picked back up, with a notoriety for juicy, incredibly clean coffees.</p>
        <p>In the past couple decades some coffee farmers have migrated to other crops. Between the fluctuations that can happen in the coffee market, and the risk of crop threatening fungus "leaf rust", coffee farming in Guatemala can be quite stressful.</p>

        <h1>The Farm</h1>
        <p>ASDELFLOR (Asociación de Desarrollo Flor del Café) is a collective of just 30 members. They are all part of the Mam Mayan indigenous community, even still using the Mam language as their main language. They use a shared processing mill at 1700MASL where all the coffee is washed and dried.</p>
        <p>This particular offering is grown by 4 of the 30 members. There were only 1000 pounds produced of this particular coffee.</p>
        <p>Before coffee the farmers mainly grew corn and beans, forcing the growers to migrate to the U.S. and send money back home to their families. The change to coffee has enabled them to stay in Guatemala with their families while providing a sustainable business model.</p>
        <p>Through the work of coffee sourcing company Shared Source, ASDELFLOR was able to be put in contact with direct buyers, ensuring they can sell well above the low market prices, while providing great coffee to those looking for it.</p>

      <h1>Brewing</h1>
      <p>For brewing this coffee I am using the Kalita wave. The defining characteristics of the Kalita Wave are that it is a flat bottom cone with three small holes in the bottom. In my experiences with coffee drippers, the Kalita provides the consistency
        between brews, while bringing a nice balance of body and acidity.</p>
      <p>When dialing in our coffees, we use a refractometer to measure how effectively we are extracting the coffee. By measuring our extractions, we are able to adjust our brewing variables accordingly, bringing forward the best possible cup of coffee.</p>
